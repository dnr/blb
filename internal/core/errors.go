	//------ Error from the raft level ------//

	// ErrRaftTimeout means a proposal timed out, most likely because the
	// quorum is not available due to node/network failures. The user should
	// retry but with caution -- there is chance that the operation succeeds

	// idempotent, the user needs to verify before retrying.
