// snapshotLoop is the goroutine that is responsible for writing application's
// state to a snapshot file. It works with fsmLoop and coreLoop to take a
// snapshot. The process of taking a snapshot is as the follows:
//
// 1. fsmLoop decides when to take a snapshot and asks applications to prepare
//    for taking a snapshot by calling "FSM.Snapshot" to get a "Snapshoter".
//    Because the fsmLoop is also responsible for applying commands so it knows
//    the index and term of the last applied command at the time "Snapshoter" is
//    returned. The fsmLoop will passe these informations to the snapshotLoop.
//
// 2. snapshotLoop is responsible for calling "Snapshoter.Save" to dump state of
//    the application to a temporary file. To avoid the race, snapshotLoop will
//    ask coreLoop to commit the snapshot file.
//
// 3. Once coreLoop receives the snapshot commit request from snapshotLoop, it
//    will commit the temporary snapshot file to make it visible and trim the
//    log if necessary.
