// 'existing' are the hosts that already had the tract. We try not to pick hosts
// from their failure domains but may do so if no other options are available.

// hierarchy and picks hosts that have different domains at the current level.
// If there aren't enough on this level, go down one more level and repeat. When
// it eventually hits the tractserver level, if there aren't enough distinct
// tractservers as replacement, it returns with nil. Otherwise, it picks
