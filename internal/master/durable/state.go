// State is the durable state that can only be mutated by Raft. There is no need
// to maintain a lock as Raft is responsible for serializing commands.

	// 1. CuratorIDs never go away and
	// 2. CuratorIDs are never reused.
	//
	// Curators own metadata, and to lose a curator replica group entirely
	// would be a disaster that we would have to recover from by determining
	// which blobIDs were not managed by a curator. In this case, we might
	// as well use the same CuratorID. Also, we can change this decision later.
	//
	// The slice is indexed by the partition IDs and stores curator IDs.
	// Note that valid partition and curator IDs start from 1 and thus we
	// reserve the first spot. This layout optimizes the lookup from blob
	// (partition) to curator with O(1) cost but has O(n) cost for returning
	// the list of partitions owned by a given curator. An alternative is to
	// store the reversed mapping from curators to list of partitions, which
	// works best for the second query. We opt for this design because the
